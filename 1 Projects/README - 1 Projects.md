## Purpose

This folder should list all your active projects.
It is designed to be on top of the structure because those are the most actionable contents you should manage.

## Usage

### Generating a project

You can quickly create a new project with a minimal structure by doing the following:
1. Press `Ctrl+N` and write your title with your project name. For example `Ninja WebApp`. 
2. **Once the title written, it is very important to move your cursor out of the title section (the simplest way is to press `tab`)** 
3. Then press `Ctrl+Shift+Â¨` 

### Generating a meeting

You can quickly create a new meeting within a project by doing the following:
1. Press `Ctrl+N` and write your title in the format `Kind of my project - project name`, for example `Weekly - Ninja WebApp`. 
2. **Once the title written, it is very important to move your cursor out of the title section (the simplest way is to press `tab`)** 
3. Then press `Ctrl+Shift+M` 

The date is auto-generated by taking the current day. If you want to change it, you might want to adapt both the generated title and the property.
