## Purpose

This folder orders your notes in a time dimension. Usually, when you open your obsidian vault, a daily note of the current day is autogenerated. It should be very rare to create manually a note in this folder.

## Usage

It should be autogenerated. You can use the calendar in the upper right to either open an existing note or create one.

The template expects you to write your tasks in the `Today's tasks` section. It will become *unscheduled* if the task was scheduled in a date prior to the current day. If the task is important enough to be scheduled in the future, you can open the daily note of the corresponding deadline in the calendar and write it there.

The section `Logs` is to help you write quickly unstructured content there. If one day you notice you often write the same kind of content, then you could try to template it and move the content somewhere else.

Other sections are autogenerated and works well if you take leverage of the `Meetings` template and the `Today's tasks` sections.
