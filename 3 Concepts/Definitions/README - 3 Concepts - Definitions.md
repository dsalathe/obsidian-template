## Purpose

Those are the building blocks of your second brain. They are usually not really actionable but might be linked to many other notes. It is expected to be filled when you have time to do some retro-documentation.

## Usage

1. Create a new note with `Ctrl+N` or click on a link you created mentioning the concept.
2. Write in the title the name of the concept. It can be `Fishing` or `Software Engineering`.
3. Press `Ctrl+Shift+D`

You are free to copy paste a Wikipedia page for those kind of notes but my advice is to write your own understanding and point of view of the concept. if you want a more formal documentation like a Wikipedia page as well, then I advice to use the markdown syntax to make a nice link, as I just did here with a [markdown summary link](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/).

- Use `topic` to write the parent concept if you want a hierarchy of your concepts.
- Use `tags` to generally tag your concept with something. For example, the concept `Google` could be tagged with `Company`, `Tech`, etc.
- Use `aliases` to refer to the concept with aliases. For example, the concept `United Nations` could be aliased with `UN`.
